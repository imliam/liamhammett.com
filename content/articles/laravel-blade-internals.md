In this short video series, I take you through Laravel Blade and some things I've picked up from using it extensively for a long time.

We'll see how to make Blade work from plain PHP, the additional things it does under-the-hood, how to disable the view cache, extend Blade and write your own custom directives that work reliably and effectively. Come along for the ride and watch the series.
