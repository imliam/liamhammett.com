For the last couple of decades, I've been an avid advocate for RSS feeds. I'd sit down with a morning coffee and read the last day's posts. It's been a great way to keep up with the latest content from my favourite websites and blogs, and I've always enjoyed the control it's give me over what I read.

However, I've noticed a shift in my habits over the last couple of years, as my life has gotten busier and I've had less free time...

- üïê **Managing RSS feeds is time consuming**. You need to look out for new feeds to subscribe to and prune old ones.

Sure, you can just stick with your current feeds and not worry about it, but then you're not getting the most out of the technology. You'll find over the years there are feeds you just don't care about now for whatever reason (maybe the content changed, or maybe your interests did).

Even if you keep some feeds, not all their posts might be great. You might find yourself skipping over a lot of content that you're not interested in, which is a waste of time, especially if you only vibe with 1 out of every 10 posts.

- üíÅ **Social Media is curated content**. If you make a habit of following good people on social media sites like [X](https://x.com/LiamHammett), you'll inevitably find them sharing content they like as well.

In particular, I find [X](https://x.com/LiamHammett) to be a great source of content. Accounts like [Laravel News Links](https://twitter.com/LaravelLinks) and people like [Freek Van der Herten](https://twitter.com/freekmurze) are great for sharing content that I'm interested in in the PHP and web development space, and I know that if they're going out of their way to share something then it's probably good.

But the best thing is that I don't have to put active effort into finding stuff they shared. I can just scroll through my feed and see what they've posted.

So, while my RSS reader isn't going anywhere, I'm definitely embracing the curated ease of social media more and more.

Have you found yourself ditching RSS for the quick scroll of social media?
