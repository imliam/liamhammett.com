## But wait, there's more!

Don't spend all your hard earned money just yet! It's not actually Black Friday at the time of writing this, so there's likely to be more things to come. Notably:

- The long awaited [Refactoring UI Book](https://refactoringui.com/) by Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan is set to come out before Christmas
- Enrollment to Laura Elizabeth's [Design Fundamentals Course](https://designacademy.io/design-fundamentals/?__s=usxpuzfcbbjw5wz5woqy) is open for the next few days
- Ahmad Awais' [VSCode Pro course](https://vscode.pro/) is launching with 40% off
- Get 25% off of 2 months of the zero downtime deployment tool [Ploi](https://ploi.io/news/black-friday-2018-is-coming-up) with discount code `BLACKFRIDAY2018`

I've personally picked up most of these courses and products over the last couple of years and would recommend every single one of them at their full price within a heartbeat - they are all top-notch quality and will either save you countless hours of development time or build your skills in ways you never expected could be so good.

The Laravel community in particular has some of the best people in the internet all coming together with the goal of sharing their knowledge and improving everyone else's work and lives, and I'm deeply thankful to everyone who has published a product on this list as together they've changed the way I look at programming and made me love it more than I ever expected I could a few years ago.
