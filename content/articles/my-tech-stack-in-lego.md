Developers love building things, and what's better to build than LEGO?

I recently won a LEGO elePHPant from [PHPverse 2025](https://lp.jetbrains.com/phpverse-2025/) and [Bricked It](https://bricked-it.com/) had a sale, so I picked up a few more pieces to showcase my preferred tech stack with LEGO.

In fact, the LEGO elePHPant is pretty much the same size as the squishier members of its herd!

If you want to see them being built, I recorded a timelapse of the process you can see here:
