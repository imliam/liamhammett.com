An extension for Visual Studio Code that lets you quickly flow between files, allowing you to make smooth coding presentations.

File Flow is designed to make it easier to give presentations within VSCode itself. You can prepare some files and seamlessly transition through them from one to the next with a quick key press.

Think of it like very simple slideshows for VSCode.
