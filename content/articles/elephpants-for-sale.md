PHP folks _love_ elephpants. It's the mascot that just brings joy to us, but they can be hard to get hold of, often only being given out at conferences or events.

![My herd of elephpants](/images/articles/holding-elephpants.jpg){.no-shadow}

At the end of [PHPverse 2025](https://lp.jetbrains.com/phpverse-2025/), some folks in the Discord server were showing off their herd of elePHPants and shared several that were available for sale.

I've collected all the links from that discussion as well as any others I could find for sale online, and I've put all of them here so that anyone who wants to buy one can easily find them - elePHPants are not always easy to find in the wild!
