"PHP is dead", someone cries. "No, PHP is _not_ dead!" a passionate fan replies. And just like that, they've reinforced the idea that it is.

It sounds absurd ‚Äî but it's how our brains work.

We say "PHP is not dead"... and all they hear is "PHP" and "dead".

<h2>The Pink Elephant Paradox</h2>

This happens all the time in language - we think we're correcting a myth, but end up reinforcing it instead.

As cognitive linguist George Lakoff discusses in his 2004 book "Don't Think of an Elephant!", language influences thought and perception in very specific ways. Despite the very title of the book telling you not to, the first thing that comes to mind when you read it is an elephant - a classic example of how framing a point can work against your favour.

<x-quote name="George Lakoff" title="Know Your Values and Frame the Debate">Don't think of an elephant</x-quote>

This is often referred to as the "pink elephant paradox" or "[ironic process theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ironic_process_theory)", the idea that attempting to suppress a thought only makes it more likely to surface.

When we process a negation in language, we must first comprehend the underlying concept before negating it - meaning the original idea itself gets activated in our mind, highlighting the very concept we are trying to suppress.

So when we read "PHP is not dead", our brains still register the ideas of "PHP" and "dead" together, causing "PHP is <span class="text-gray-400 transition-all blur-sm hover:blur-0" aria-hidden="true">not</span> dead" to be what springs to mind as the primary concept.

As programmers, it feels very easy to try and simply negate a concept - our brains are wired like that when we think about code...

```diff
- $php === $dead
+ $php !== $dead
```

...but human brains just don't parse natural language like an interpreter parses code.

## Reframing Our Argument

So how do we fight the "PHP is dead" narrative?

Not by denying it - but by **replacing it with something stronger**.

Be careful not to just flip the wording; "PHP is alive" still carries the connotation that it could've been dead by virtue of the word "alive" in it.

Instead, shift the perception with a different sentiment altogether, such as "PHP is thriving" or "PHP is better than ever". This shifts the focus from the negative to the positive, allowing for a more constructive conversation.

If possible, **back up the argument** with information that supports your claim. If you're looking to show that PHP is thriving, highlight what's new and exciting:

- üë• **1 in 5 developers use PHP** - a huge share! (_according to the [StackOverflow 2024 survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)_)
- ‚öôÔ∏è **[php.new](https://php.new/)** makes it easier than ever for anyone to get started with PHP
- üì± **[NativePHP](https://nativephp.com/)** lets you use PHP to build apps for desktop and mobile, not just the web
- üÜï **[The PHP Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/)** is directly backing the development of PHP, bringing new features every release
- ‚ö° **[FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev)** brings insane performance improvements to any PHP application
- üí∏ **Laravel received a [$57 million investment from Accel](https://blog.laravel.com/accel-invests-57m-into-laravel)**, proving there is real money interested in the PHP ecosystem

## Why The Narrative Matters

**Language shapes perception - and perception drives adoption.**

If new developers keep hearing "PHP is dead", they'll choose another stack before they even have a chance to explore PHP's wonderful ecosystem.

Fewer developers means lower adoption, fewer companies using it, less funding for PHP-based projects, fewer PHP jobs on the market, lower salaries for those that remain, and ultimately a less vibrant community.

In a panel discussion at PHP UK 2025 on the topic of PHP's future, Nils Andermann eloquently explained how the "PHP is not dead" narrative is damaging to the community.

If you're out there championing PHP, stop repeating the myths - even to debunk them.

Don't feed the narrative. Rewrite it.

==PHP doesn't need defending. It needs celebrating.==
