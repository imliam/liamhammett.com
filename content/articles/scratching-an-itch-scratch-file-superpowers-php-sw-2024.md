Do you often find yourself reaching for scratch files â€” those unsaved, ephemeral windows where you quickly prototype, test ideas, and run snippets of code.

What if these temporary spaces could be supercharged to better fit your everyday needs? We'll journey through how I scratched my own itch to build tooling that makes scratch files so much better, saving you time and brain power when writing code so you can focus on your problem and not boilerplate. We'll learn about the power of autoloaders, dynamically requiring packages on-the-fly, techniques and processes to save time, and even building a functioning REPL.

This is a talk I presented at the PHPSW meetup in November 2024.
