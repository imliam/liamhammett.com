For years, I didn't get the hype around newsletters by individual content creators.

Why would I want to let someone to spam my inbox? If I wanted their content, I could follow their blog, their RSS feed, their Twitter account... why clog up my email?

But I was missing the point.

Newsletters aren't just about distribution. _They're about connection._

On Twitter, if you hit "reply" to a thread, you're one voice in a noisy mob. You might get noticed, but you probably won't.

With a newsletter, when you hit "reply", your message goes straight to the author. No algorithm. No audience watching. Just you and them. And most of the time? From my experience, they'll actually write back.

That makes newsletters feel more personal, more intimate, more human.

It took me decades to realise this - but now I get it.

Newsletters aren't just about content delivery. ==They're about conversation.==
