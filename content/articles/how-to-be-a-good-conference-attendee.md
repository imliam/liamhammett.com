When you go to a conference, you can sit there and take in the information from the talk, but what can you do to make it a better experience for the speaker?

## 1. Choose Your Seat Wisely

Where you sit can have a big impact on how well you can see and hear the speaker - and how well they can see and hear you.

Sit closer to the front if you can, especially if you're going to be asking questions or engaging with the speaker. This will make it easier for you to hear them, and for them to see you. You'll also be taking up more of the speaker's field of vision, which can help them feel more connected to the audience.

If you're going to be on your phone or getting a laptop out to take notes or do something else, sit near the back so you don't distract the speaker or other attendees.

## 2. Engage Actively

Engaging with the speaker is a great way to show that you're interested in what they're saying. If there are any prompts for audience participation, don't be afraid to join in - raise your hand if the group is asked a question, laugh along to jokes when they're made, ask questions or make comments during the Q&A session.

Even if the speaker isn't directly trying to get the audience involved, you can still show that you're engaged by nodding along, making eye contact, smiling when they make a good point, and showing that you're listening.

## 3. Talk to the Speaker After

If you have any questions or comments that you didn't get a chance to ask during the talk, don't be afraid to go up and talk to the speaker either directly after or when you see them later in the conference. They'll appreciate the feedback, and it can be a great way to start a conversation and make a connection.

Even if you don't have any questions, don't be afraid to go up and say thank you - it can mean a lot to the speaker to know that their talk was appreciated.

## 4. Give Honest Feedback

Speakers are often giving the same talk at multiple conferences back-to-back, so any genuine feedback you have for the talk can help them improve it for future audiences. If you have any suggestions for how they could make the talk better, or if there was something you particularly liked and think they should emphasise, don't be afraid to let them know.

If a conference has some kind of feedback form or tool like [joind.in](https://joind.in/), make sure to take the time to fill it out - it can help the organisers and speakers know what worked and what didn't and is invaluable to them.

## 5. Share the Talk

If you really enjoyed the talk, don't keep it to yourself...

- share the knowledge you gained with your friends and colleagues
- talk about it on social media, with a photo you snapped of the speaker on stage
- repost any social posts made by the speaker or conference organisers about the talk

These little things don't take up much effort on your part, certainly not as much effort as the speaker put into preparing and delivering the talk, but they can make a big difference to the speaker and the conference as a whole.
