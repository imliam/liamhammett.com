If you've not heard already, I announced on Twitter the other day that I'll be starting a Livewire-focussed newsletter.

I plan to use this as a space to help make people aware about all the new minor features in Livewire that don't get their own big announcement, as well as general community updates and ðŸ”¥ tips to get the most out of Livewire.
