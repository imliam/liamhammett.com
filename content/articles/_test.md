I was wondering how to start this article, then I had a thought...

<x-thought>I'm thinking here... what if we had an <mark>**amazing**</mark> time in Tijuana and got <u>_really_</u> high?</x-thought>

<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>

```php{3}{5,6}
<?php

function foo()
{
-    echo 'Goodbye world';
+    echo 'Hello world';
}
```

{.bg-red-300 .rounded-2xl .px-8 .py-4}
This is a normal element.

{.bg-red-300 .mx-break-out .rounded-2xl .px-8 .py-4}
This is a breakout element.

<div class="bg-blue-300 text-blue-900 mx-full py-16 my-16 full-width-quote">
<div class="container mx-auto max-w-3xl">
<h2>Full-width element</h2>

This is a full-width element.

Here we can have some kind of long lorem-ipsum text to make this span a few lines at the very least, just to make sure the text legibility is still good enough to warrant having a line like this.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Germany** is a country that is very efficient and has no humour, says everyone else in the world.
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The **United Kingdom** is another country that has a very dry sense of humour.
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **France** is a country that has great wine and cheese. They are even hosting the 2024 Olympics, though the Siene river's cleanliness has been a bit of a contentious point.
