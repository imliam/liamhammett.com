This article is a test article to see how things look. The content is not to be taken seriously, just as a reference and test-bed.

The last paragraph is a ==leading paragraph==. The text should be bigger and therefore a little bit more impactful as someone starts reading the post.

## Timeline Lists

### Works with hourly lists

(e.g. live reports)

- 09:00 - Wake up and <u>fight</u>
- 09:30 - Breakfast
- 10:00 - Work
- 12:00 - Lunch
- 13:00 - Work
- 17:00 - Finish work
- 18:00 - Dinner
- 22:00 - Sleep

### Works with date lists

- 2024-01-01 - New Year's Day
- 2024-03-17 - St. Patrick's Day
- 2024-12-25 - Christmas Day
- 2024-12-26 - Boxing Day
- 2024-12-31 - New Year's Eve

I had a thought...

<x-thought>What if I had an <mark>**amazingly**</mark> simple site to write for, but it looked <u>_really_</u> cool?</x-thought>

```php{3}{5,6}
<?php

function foo()
{
-    echo 'Goodbye world';
+    echo 'Hello world';
}
```

{.bg-red-300 .rounded-2xl .px-8 .py-4}
This is a normal element.

{.bg-red-300 .mx-break-out .rounded-2xl .px-8 .py-4}
This is a breakout element.

<div class="bg-blue-300 text-blue-900 mx-full py-16 my-16 px-8 full-width-quote">
<div class="container mx-auto max-w-3xl">
<h2>Full-width element</h2>

This is a full-width element.

Here we can have some kind of long lorem-ipsum text to make this span a few lines at the very least, just to make sure the text legibility is still good enough to warrant having a line like this.

- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª **Germany** is a country, and this is a list of countries, but this one is first on the list.
- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The **United Kingdom** is another country on the list of countries.
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· **France** is a country that is coming third on the list of countries here, just to see how the list of countries may look when there is a lot of text here. Hopefully, it looks pretty dandy.
